        With 3 bedrooms, the Gosford is perfect for anyone looking for a little
        extra space. The open plan kitchen has double doors that look out onto
        the garden, perfect for keeping an eye on the kids playing in the garden
        or hosting a BBQ with friends in the summer. The cosy living room at the
        front of the home is just perfect for chilling out in the evenings. The
        Gosford is one of our top sellers, and with two double bedrooms and a
        further single suitable for a child or even a study, its easy to see
        why.
